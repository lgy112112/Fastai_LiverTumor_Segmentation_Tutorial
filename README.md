# Fastai_LiverTumor_Segmentation_Tutorial
Based on LiTs challenge on Kaggle. Operation on run and issues will be due heard.
This repo uses Fastai as model buider (UNet with ResNet50 as backbone)
After 60 epochs of training, it perform fairly fine.
Just to notice, preprocess is equally important to network.
